## Abstract 

Delays to hospital discharge impact the wider healthcare system and are a contributory factor to emergency department overcrowding, ambulance offload and response delays experienced both in the UK and globally. Health and care services comprising of care provided in community facilities and at home support timely discharge from hospital for patients with complex care needs. It attempts to avoid costly discharge delays and consequent risks to patient physical and mental health. Home care is provided by visiting care staff in patients’ homes, with time-varying visit requirements, typically reducing over time. This paper reports the development of a novel discrete-time stochastic simulation model in a large health and social care system in England, which models patients using a time-varying resource draw, rather than a fixed capacitated resource. Our results are compared to steady-state and time-dependent analytical approximations to identify areas of the parameter space in our case study where the analytical models perform sufficiently well, and to enable an empirical case for the use of time-varying resources to model visits-based home care. The flexibility of our simulation model and our purposeful engagement with stakeholders have enabled the resulting tool to be in routine use for home care resource planning. It is available open source for take-up by researchers or analysts involved in home care demand and capacity planning.

This study aims to demonstrate how, counter to intuition, pursual of elimination of acute delayed transfers of care is likely to be uneconomical, as it would require large amounts of community capacity to accommodate even the rarest of demand peaks, leaving much capacity unused for much of the time.

An application of the discrete-time simulation model showing that total costs across the acute-community interface can be minimized by identifying optimal community capacity in terms of the maximum number of patients for which home visits can be provided by the service.

This paper reports on the development and deployment of the versatile IPACS simulation tool for modelling both the home-based and bedded community step-down pathways, known as ‘Discharge to Assess’  in England’s NHS. Developed in open source ‘R’, the tool offers scalable solutions for exploring different scenarios relating to demand, capacity and patient length of stay.
